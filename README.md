### Hi there, I'm Michele ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer, full-stack developer, geek and Agile enthusiast. I love coding and problem solving. I started coding when I was very young just for fun, by creating Basic and Pascal programs. It's been many years since the day I wrote my first line of code and some white hairs started appearing in my beard. Over the years, I had the opportunity to study and play with many systems, different programming languages and frameworks. Currenctly, I am involved in designing and developing software solutions, building applications for Web, Mobile and Desktop.
